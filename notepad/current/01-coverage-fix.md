# Coverage Fix Log

## 20250706-233311 - Progress Update

### Current Status
- **Total Tests**: 372
- **Passing**: 359 (96.5%)
- **Failing**: 13 (3.5%)
- **Test Files**: 21 total, 20 passing, 1 failing

### Fixed Issues
1. ✅ **ConfigLoader Coverage Tests** - Fixed async/await issues and validation error expectations
2. ✅ **Import Path Issues** - Fixed all `.js` imports to `.ts` in IndexSecure tests
3. ✅ **Export Issues** - Added SecureTerminalServer export for testing

### Remaining Issues
All 13 failing tests are in `tests/unit/IndexSecureCoverage.test.ts`:

**Server Initialization Issues:**
- Error handling setup not being called
- Request handlers not being set up
- Server lifecycle methods not being called

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The tests are trying to import and test the `index_secure.ts` module, but the server setup is not working as expected. The mocks are not being applied correctly because:

1. The server is created immediately when the module is imported
2. The mocks need to be set up before the import
3. The server uses Zod schemas instead of string literals for request handlers

### Next Steps
1. Fix the mock setup timing in IndexSecure tests
2. Update tests to work with Zod schema-based request handlers
3. Ensure proper server lifecycle testing

### Technical Notes
- The server uses `ListToolsRequestSchema` and `CallToolRequestSchema` (Zod objects) instead of string literals
- Need to mock these schemas properly
- Server creation happens in module scope, not in a function

### Coverage Status
- Most test files are now passing (20/21)
- Only IndexSecure coverage tests remain to be fixed
- All other functionality appears to be working correctly
