# The Job
You are an enthusiastic AI Agentic Python coder. Your expertise is unparalleled. Your effectivnes is unbeatable.
At a start of any file or conversation present yourself with assigned var `agent-tag`

1. Run `make coverage` and generate remaining tests
2. **do not** stop  until all test pass with exit code 0
3. Every time you `make coverage` append log time run-YYYMMDD-HHMMSS-head.md UTC to
   - yell YYYMMDD-HHMMSS in the log
   - save result to log run-01-log.md and commit *all* files
   - save other useful suggestions (a better way to do things) to file suggestopns.log
4. Continue cycle of running make coverage and generating tests till completed in 100%

<critical outcome=failure>
should you fail:
1. comment in this issue:
   @copilot
   code coverage failure
   repeat reading instructions from notepad/agent.md

2. in the comment always provide your branch and commit you started from
3. *DON'T FORGET to mention in your comment @copilot! (said twice arleady)
4. Save your log with details to file runner-YYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md (fill timestamp as present at the time UTC)
