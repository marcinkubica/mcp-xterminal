# Coverage Fixing Task Analysis and Plan - 01

## Task Overview
Based on `01-agent.md`, the task is to run `npx vitest run --coverage` and fix all issues until exit code 0, with comprehensive logging and failure protocols.

## Task Requirements

1. **Primary Goal**: Run `npx vitest run --coverage` and fix all issues until exit code 0
2. **Logging**: Log timestamps (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS) for each vitest run
3. **Documentation**: Save results to `01-log.md` and other interesting findings
4. **Failure Protocol**: Create GitHub issue with specific instructions if I fail

## Possible Outcomes Analysis

### Outcome 1: Immediate Success
- **Scenario**: All tests pass on first run, coverage is 100%
- **Probability**: Low (given it's a "fixer" task)
- **Action**: Log success, document final state, task complete

### Outcome 2: Coverage Issues Found and Fixable
- **Scenario**: Tests fail due to missing coverage, but issues are straightforward to fix
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Actions**:
  - Identify uncovered code paths
  - Add missing test cases
  - Iterate until all tests pass
  - Document fixes in log

### Outcome 3: Complex Test Failures
- **Scenario**: Tests fail due to logic errors, not just coverage
- **Probability**: Medium-High
- **Actions**:
  - Debug failing tests
  - Fix underlying code issues
  - Ensure no regression
  - Maintain existing functionality

### Outcome 4: Configuration Issues
- **Scenario**: Vitest configuration problems, missing dependencies
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Actions**:
  - Check package.json, vitest.config.ts
  - Install missing dependencies
  - Fix configuration issues
  - Verify environment setup

### Outcome 5: Critical Failure - Cannot Complete
- **Scenario**: Issues too complex, time constraints, or fundamental problems
- **Probability**: Low-Medium
- **Actions** (as specified in failure protocol):
  1. Create GitHub issue with exact same job description
  2. Document current branch and commit hash
  3. Recommend whether to start new branch or continue current
  4. Assign to @copilot
  5. Provide detailed failure analysis

## My Approach Strategy

1. **Start with Assessment**: Run vitest to understand current state
2. **Systematic Fixing**: Address issues one by one, prioritizing:
   - Configuration problems
   - Missing dependencies
   - Test failures
   - Coverage gaps
3. **Continuous Logging**: Document every step and timestamp
4. **Iterative Process**: Keep running vitest until success
5. **Failure Planning**: If I hit insurmountable issues, follow the failure protocol exactly

## Key Considerations

- **No Stopping**: Must continue until exit code 0 or complete failure
- **Documentation**: Every run must be logged with timestamp
- **Code Quality**: Cannot remove existing features or use dummy code
- **Clean Code Principles**: Must follow Uncle Bob's principles
- **Environment**: Must use proper Node.js setup with virtual environment if needed

## Technical Stack Context
- **Node.js**: Primary runtime
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol framework
- **Vitest**: Testing framework with coverage reporting
- **TypeScript**: Based on project structure (.ts files)

## Project Structure Analysis
Based on the workspace layout, this appears to be an MCP (Model Context Protocol) terminal extension with:
- Validation system (multiple validator types)
- Configuration management
- Security boundaries
- Comprehensive test suite

The task is well-defined with clear success criteria and failure protocols, making it a systematic debugging and testing exercise that can be approached methodically.
