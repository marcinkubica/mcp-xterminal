# mcp-xterminal

![xterminal](xterminal.png)

A MCP server that suppose to work around Copilot inability to autonomously execute terminal commands.

Initially forked from [stat-guy/terminal](https://github.com/stat-guy/terminal)

`Project is moving but is a prototype until release 0.1.0 (with npm package)`

Check PRs for work in progress and `docs/building` for iteration stages, work done and  planned.

## What it does

Secure MCP server that enables AI agents to execute terminal commands with security controls:

- **Whitelisted commands only** - Configurable blocking of commands (rm, curl, sudo, etc.)
- **Directory boundaries** - Restricts access to specified directories
- **Argument validation** - Configurable prevention of command injection attacks
- **MCP protocol compliant** - Works with VS Code Copilot and other MCP clients

## Tools provided

- `execute_command` - Run whitelisted shell commands
- `change_directory` - Navigate within boundary directories
- `get_current_directory` - Get current working directory
- `get_terminal_info` - System and session information
- `list_allowed_commands` - Show all whitelisted commands

## Security features

- ðŸ”’ Command whitelist with 28+ safe commands
- ðŸ”’ Directory traversal protection
- ðŸ”’ Argument count and pattern validation
- ðŸ”’ Configurable boundary directory enforcement
- ðŸ”’ No network access commands allowed

## Key Differences

And these explain why Copilot Agent has no autorun mode.

### **`run_in_terminal`** (VS Code built-in):
- Full shell access with no restrictions
- Can run any command
- Persistent terminal session
- Can run background processes
- Direct shell execution

### **MCP Terminal Tools** (this project):
- Security-restricted command execution
- Whitelisted commands only
- Directory boundary enforcement
- Argument validation
- No dangerous commands allowed

xterminal tools are intented to be the secure alternative to `run_in_terminal` for AI agents.


## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Configure in VS Code MCP settings:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "terminal": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["~/path/to/mcp-xterminal/dist/index.js"],
        "env": {
          "BOUNDARY_DIR": "/safe/directory/path",
          "COMMAND_VALIDATION": "aggressive"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`COMMAND_VALIDATION` is one of 
- `aggressive` (default): Maximum security, 28 whitelisted commands
- `medium`: Balanced security, 32 whitelisted commands  
- `minimal`: Basic validation, no command whitelist
- `none`: No validation, all commands allowed. Dangenrous on your laptop, safer for isolated deployments (ie. in docker)

For custom validation configurations:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "terminal": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["~/path/to/mcp-xterminal/dist/index.js"],
        "env": {
          "BOUNDARY_DIR": "/safe/directory/path",
          "COMMAND_VALIDATION": "config/validation/my-custom.yaml"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Copilot Instructions

By default Copilot will favour to use internal commands.
To help steering agent in the correct direction :) add below to your `copilot-instructions.md`

```
<critical type=terminal_commands>
1. **ONLY** use following tools:
   - `execute_command`
   - `change_directory`
   - `get_current_directory`
   - `get_terminal_info`
   - `list_allowed_commands`
2. **IMPORTANT** INFORM USER IF TOOL DOESN"T SUPPORT YOUR NEEDS FOR THE TASK
3. **IMPORTANT** NEVER BYPASS THE TOOLS, INFORM THE USER OF A PROBLEM
4. **IMPORTANT** TOOLS NOT ALLOWED:
   - `run_in_terminal`
</critical>
```

This stanza is also already [provided](.github/copilot-instructions.md) (view in raw) in the project with other very useful directives for programming. Feel free to copy into your project.

## Validation Configuration

The MCP XTerminal supports flexible validation configurations through environment variables:

### Built-in Validation Levels
```bash
# Aggressive validation (default) - 28 whitelisted commands
COMMAND_VALIDATION=aggressive

# Medium validation - 32 whitelisted commands  
COMMAND_VALIDATION=medium

# Minimal validation - basic checks only
COMMAND_VALIDATION=minimal

# No validation - all commands allowed (useful but *dangerous!*)
COMMAND_VALIDATION=none
```

### Custom Validation
Create your own validation rules with custom YAML files:

```bash
# Using relative path
COMMAND_VALIDATION=config/validation/my-custom.yaml

# Using absolute path  
COMMAND_VALIDATION=/path/to/my/custom-validation.yaml
```

Example custom configuration:
```yaml
validation_level: custom
description: "Development environment security"

allowed_commands:
  ls: "List directory contents"
  cat: "Display file contents"
  pwd: "Print working directory"
  git: "Git operations"
  node: "Node.js operations"
  npm: "NPM operations"

forbidden_patterns:
  - "rm\\s"
  - "sudo\\s"
  - "\\|\\s*sh"

limits:
  max_arguments: 20
  timeout_max: 30000
```

For detailed custom validation configuration, see [Command Validation](docs/command-validation).
