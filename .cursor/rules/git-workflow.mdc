# Git Workflow Practices

## Commit Signing
- All commits are automatically signed with GPG
- For deblock-hq repositories, a specific signing key is used: 714536E5000A6DDFD61F4F80566F49F6BD7B8636

## Branch Management
- Pull requests use fast-forward only mode
- Remote branches are automatically set up when pushing

## Git Hooks
- Custom hooks path is configured at `/Users/marcin/.git-hooks`
- These hooks may contain project-specific automation

## Identity Management
- Git automatically switches between personal and work identities based on repository location
- Work identity (marcin@deblock.com) is used for repositories in `~/Projects/deblock-hq/`
- Personal identity (bufka@dupa.pl) is used for all other repositories
