# Test Coverage Fix Log

## Run #1 - 20250706-231507

ðŸ”¥ **COVERAGE IS MY LIFE! LFG!** ðŸ”¥

### Results:
- **Exit Code**: 1 (FAILURE)
- **Test Files**: 1 failed | 20 passed (21)
- **Tests**: 12 failed | 360 passed (372)
- **Duration**: 3.22s

### Issues Found:
1. **IndexSecureCoverage.test.ts** - Multiple failures:
   - Server initialization not properly mocked
   - Request handlers not being set up correctly
   - CallHandler undefined in multiple tests
   - Console spy expectations not met

### Key Problems:
- The `IndexSecureCoverage.test.ts` test file is trying to test server initialization but the mocks aren't working properly
- The test is importing `../../src/index_secure.ts` but the handlers are not being extracted correctly
- Server mock is not being called as expected

### Next Steps:
1. Fix the mock setup in IndexSecureCoverage.test.ts
2. Ensure proper handler extraction from server mock calls
3. Fix console spy expectations
4. Re-run tests

### Analysis:
The main issue is in the `IndexSecureCoverage.test.ts` file where the server mocking is not working correctly. The test is trying to dynamically import the index_secure module and extract handlers from mock calls, but this approach is failing.
